### a. Instructions about how to run and test your code.
# Movie List App

This project is a Movie List application that allows users to view a list of upcoming movies, search for movies, and view movie details.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.
5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the app.

Note : I am aware of not to commit env files but for testing purpose i did and key will be disabled after 5 days. Then you have to create your own key from the https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api .
## Test Cases

Due to time constraints related to my office work, I was unable to write comprehensive test cases for the application. Testing is an essential part of ensuring the stability and correctness of the codebase, and I acknowledge its importance. While I haven't included tests in the current version of the project, I plan to allocate time in the future to add unit tests and integration tests to cover different components, behaviors, and use cases.

I understand that having a robust test suite is beneficial for long-term maintainability and development, and I intend to prioritize this aspect as I continue to work on the project.

## Elements Demonstrating Proficiency

1. **Dependency Management:** Effectively managed project dependencies using `package.json`, with attention to specific versions for dependencies such as `@mui/material`, `axios`, `lodash`, and more.

2. **Styling and UI Frameworks:** Leveraged styling tools such as `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`, and `tailwindcss` to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.

3. **Third-Party Integrations:** Integrated third-party libraries like `@mui/material`, `axios`, and `react-router-dom`, demonstrating the ability to select and utilize appropriate tools for enhancing functionality.

4. **Dynamic UI Features:** Incorporated the `react-infinite-scroll-component` library to implement dynamic features like infinite scrolling, enhancing the user experience with continuous content loading.

5. **API Integration:** Utilized the `axios` library to effectively integrate external APIs, fetching movie data and search results seamlessly.

## Possible Improvements

If I had 4 more hours, I would focus on:

1. **Enhanced Test Coverage:** Dedicate time to writing comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure stable functionality and maintainability.

2. **Pagination:** Implement pagination for displaying a fixed number of movies per page, enhancing user experience and load times.

3. **UI/UX Refinements:** Fine-tune the user interface, add loading indicators, and improve overall user interactions.

4. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and user-friendly error messages for scenarios like API failures.

## Feedback

Overall, the challenge has been valuable in showcasing my React skills. While I haven't included tests in the current version due to time constraints, I recognize the importance of testing and plan to prioritize it in the future. The provided feedback throughout the challenge would be helpful for future iterations.
